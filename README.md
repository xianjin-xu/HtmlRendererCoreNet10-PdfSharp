# HtmlRendererCore

[![NuGet version (HtmlRendererCore.PdfSharp)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/HtmlRendererCore.PdfSharp.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlRendererCore.PdfSharp/)
![Build](https://github.com/j-petty/HtmlRendererCore/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)

**HtmlRendererCore** is a partial port of [HtmlRendererCore](https://github.com/j-petty/HtmlRendererCore) for .NET 6+.
Previous versions of this library used `System.Drawing` which was deprecated for linux systems in .Net 6, and completely remove in .Net 7.

This library offers Html to Pdf parsing for .Net Core projects using [PdfSharpCore](https://github.com/ststeiger/PdfSharpCore). We are currently using a preview version of this lib, as other older version did not support .Net 7 as well.

Future updates will be focused at cleaning up the codebase and offering support for more advanced HTML rendering. Public pull requests welcome.

## Example usage

### Generate PDF from HTML

```cs
var pdf = PdfGenerator.GeneratePdf(html, PdfSharpCore.PageSize.A4);
```

### Generating Base64 PDF from HTML

```cs
var result = string.Empty;

using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
{
    var pdf = PdfGenerator.GeneratePdf(html, PdfSharpCore.PageSize.A4);

    pdf.Save(stream);

    result = Convert.ToBase64String(stream.ToArray());
}
```
